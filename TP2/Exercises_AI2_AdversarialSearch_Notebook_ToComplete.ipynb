    "A board game is characterized by the type of board and tiles, the rules of movement of the pieces (operators/possible moves) and the finishing conditions of the game with the respective score/result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game called \"Connect Four\" in the English language version (“4 em Linha” in the Portuguese version - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) is played on a vertical board of 7x6 squares (i.e., 7 squares wide and 6 squares high), by two players, to which are initially assigned 21 pieces to each (one of the players has white pieces and the other black pieces, or pieces \"X\" vs pieces \"O\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The two players play alternately one of their pieces. The piece to be played is placed on the top of the board and slides either to the base of the board, or in a cell immediately above another one already occupied (see previous figure). The winner will be the player who manages to obtain a line of 4 pieces of its color/symbol horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If the 42 pieces are played without any player getting a line, the final result will be a draw."
